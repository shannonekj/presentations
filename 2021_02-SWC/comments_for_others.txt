* Slide 2: capitalize effective
* instead of "what else we're going to do with genome" state "future project that will be using the genome assembly"
* sequencing takes the manual and shreds it up and then gives you pieces back
* what is medium scale? perhaps state RAD gives you sequences from locations throughout the genome
* RAD sequencing what of 2628 individuals from 1993-2018...I think... maybe 2019

Shannon
* delete blue line in RAD seq example

* what are founder alleles? can you use a different/more basic term?
* microsatellit is a complex word––can you simplify
* slide 2 figure legend larger
* maybe state C=captive, W=wild
* point arrows from green (wild) and blue (captive) fish to the orange fish
* first Fst graph the title of the slide should say "high DI" not "hi DI"
* try to say "genomic locations" not "genomic loci"
* i'd get rid of Chromosome 26 figure
